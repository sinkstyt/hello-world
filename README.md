# hello-world
I'm doing this because a webpage told me to.

I was suggested to get familiar with github BEFORE starting this two-day course in Ruby, but I left it pretty much untouched until this morning. I am hoping to get more familiar with how Github works.

I'm revisiting this file about a month later and thinking about how much I've learned since starting this thread.
